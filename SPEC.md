# Current-State Specification

## Project summary
This repository contains a single-page static website for **SNAF STUDIO** (Russian-language marketing/personal studio landing page) focused on design, frontend implementation, and launch support.

## Current architecture summary
- **HTML:** One document (`index.html`) containing all sections and loading external CSS/JS assets.
- **CSS:** Legacy monolith (`styles.css`) is preserved, and modular styles are now loaded through `styles/main.css` (`@import`-based aggregator).
- **JavaScript:** Interactive logic is now externalized in `js/main.js` (no framework, vanilla DOM APIs).
- **Assets:** Local SVG/PNG files under `images/` referenced directly from HTML/CSS.
- **Runtime model:** Client-side only, no backend or build pipeline.

## Current UX baseline (April 2026 corrective polish pass)
- Section title-to-content spacing is intentionally roomier and uses a more consistent vertical rhythm across About, Benefits, and FAQ blocks.
- Hero first-screen density is slightly tightened (moderately smaller H1 and reduced internal spacing) to fit laptop-height viewports better without changing structure/content.
- About block typography is simplified; quote card includes a subtle restored heart accent using local `images/heart-icon.svg`.
- Benefits section keeps a fully neutral page-level background; carousel cards are transparent in resting state (no permanent fill and no permanent box-shadow), with readability maintained via typography and border.
- Header/mobile menu/footer social links now use recognizable local brand assets (`images/vk.svg`, `images/tg.svg`) instead of custom glyph treatment.
- Footer preserves a 3-column desktop structure while aligning all columns from the top with consistent vertical rhythm.
- FAQ now initializes with all items closed; items toggle independently while preserving ARIA state and height animation.

## Important constraints
- Existing visual appearance and interaction behavior are baseline and must not regress.
- Section IDs are used for anchor navigation and scrollspy; changing them is high risk.
- JavaScript depends on existing class names and DOM structure.
- CSS selector names and ordering are compatibility-sensitive.

## Deployment assumptions (observed/probable)
- Observed: all paths are relative and static-host friendly.
- Confirmed: site works as plain static files (no transpilation, no bundling).

## Known current files
- `index.html`
- `styles.css` (legacy/original stylesheet retained)
- `styles/main.css`
- `styles/tokens.css`
- `styles/base.css`
- `styles/utilities.css`
- `styles/header.css`
- `styles/sections.css`
- `styles/hero.css`
- `styles/about.css`
- `styles/benefits.css`
- `styles/faq.css`
- `styles/footer.css`
- `styles/motion.css`
- `styles/responsive.css`
- `js/main.js`
- `images/logo.svg`
- `images/ivan.png`
- `images/heart-icon.svg`
- `images/wave.svg`
- `images/vk.svg`
- `images/tg.svg`

## Current frontend stack
- Semantic HTML5
- Vanilla CSS with custom properties, media queries, transitions/animations, and CSS `@import`
- Hover-driven lift effects are guarded by fine-pointer hover media queries to avoid sticky states on touch devices
- Vanilla JavaScript (`js/main.js`) using DOM APIs and IntersectionObserver
- Google Fonts (`Montserrat`) via external stylesheet link

## Known risks
- **High risk:** changing class names/IDs used by JS handlers.
- **High risk:** modifying sticky header offset logic and anchor scroll behavior.
- **Medium risk:** adjusting carousel width/gap logic can break controls/progress calculations.
- **Medium risk:** FAQ open/close animation depends on runtime height measurement and per-item toggle state sync.
- **Medium risk:** reveal/counter behavior depends on IntersectionObserver thresholds and reduced-motion handling.
- **Low risk:** `.surface-glow` hover/reveal transition timing depends on `styles/motion.css` post-reveal override targeting both direct and nested descendants.
